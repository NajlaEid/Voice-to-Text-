# Voice-to-Text-
This web application converts the voice to text 
This web application allows users to convert speech to text using javascript. When the user clicks the "Start Listening" button, the application listens for speech input and converts it to text. The text is then displayed in a text area element on the page. The "Stop Listening" button can be clicked to stop speech recognition. Then it stores the spoken sentences in a database.
